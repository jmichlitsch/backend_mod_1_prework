# In the below exercises, write code that achieves
# the desired result. To check your work, run this
# file by entering the following command in your terminal:
# `ruby day_2/exercises/arrays.rb`

# Example: Write code that stores an array in a variable,
# then prints that array:
animals = ["zebra", "giraffe", "elephant"]
puts animals

# Write code that stores an array of states in a variable,
# then prints that array:
states = ["CO", "CA", "NY", "FL"]
puts states

# Write code that stores an array of foods in a variable,
# then prints that array:
# YOUR CODE HERE
foods = ["chicken", "beef", "fish"]
# Example: Write code that prints the number of elements
# in your above array of animals:
puts animals.count

# Write code that prints the number of elements
# in your above array of foods:
# YOUR CODE HERE
puts foods.count
# Write code that prints "Zebra" from your animals array:
# YOUR CODE HERE
puts animals.first
# Write code that prints the last item of your foods array:
# YOUR CODE HERE
puts foods.last
# Write code that adds "lion" to your animals array
# and prints the result (Hint- use a method):
# YOUR CODE HERE
puts animals.push("lion")
# Write code that removes the last element from your foods array
# and prints the result (Hint- use a method):
# YOUR CODE HERE
puts foods.pop

## Day 5 Questions

1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?
Collection of data that is organized in key/value groups. An array is just an organization of groups of data.
1. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.
pet = {dog food: 7, cat food: 9, bird food:5}
1. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?
states.value(1)
1. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?
states.keys
states.values
1. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?
A list of managers and their employees. An array would only be able to set a group of employees and a group of managers separately while a hash can do it with one method.
1. What questions do you still have about hashes?
None at the moment.

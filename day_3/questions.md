## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.
That if certain conditions are met, something will happen.
if animals > cages, they will not be put outside their pins.
if cages > animals, they will be put into their cages
if pins are >= animals, they will still in their pins.
1. Why might you want to use an if-statement?
To set up a simple conditional statement.
1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?
It becomes a boolean statement with the possible values of true and false, typically with an else statement afterwards to meet the other conditions not made by the if statement.
1. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?
You would add either other if statements or add in else or elseif statements to make the statements work properly.
1. Provide an example of the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement:
if animals > cages
  puts "Animals have to stay in their enclosures"
elseif animals < cages
  puts "Animals can go into their cages"
else
  puts "Animals can either stay in enclosures or go into their cages."
end
1. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?
No, not at least in Ruby at the moment.

##Caesar's Cipher

You would first need to get what needs to be encoded before you start anywhere so you would get the user input first. Then you could go two ways on this when finding how many characters are in the cipher by either asking the user or by using a method to count them for yourself so the code will know how many too use to fit. Then you would put in a code to use any sort of characters to "scramble" the code to get it encoded.

##Checker Board
You could either start with getting input from the user themselves by using a chomp statement. Then you can just use their response to make a simplistic checker board with just 'X's being used and use the puts command to display to the user.
